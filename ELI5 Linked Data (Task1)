This ELI5 (Explain Like I’m Five) is based on this video from youtube: What is Linked Data?

Every thing in the world is linked to each other. Let’s make a example:
I have a brother (Joe), father (Pete), and mother (Eve). They are linked to 
me with a specific description as brother, father, and mother. An other connection is my girlfriend, 
she is also linked to me. These links go on and on. This structure allows us to find information; 
for example you are a friend of mine and for this reason we are linked. Otherwise you don’t have 
any links to my family. You need to know my brothers name. Due to the fact that you know, that I am 
linked with him (he is my brother), you are able to ask me for his name. It’s like a long connection 
of objects which bring you to the solution.
Whether we apply this pattern to the world wide web, we talk about Linked Data. It’s absolutly the same principe.
