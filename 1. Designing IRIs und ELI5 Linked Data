Create IRIs
I designed some IRIs for my own profile in the web. (Notice, these are fakes)

my identifier:                                http://chrigu.info/#i                         for informations about me
                                                                                            better declaration than “about” or “me”

list of work experience:                      http://chrigu.info/work/#sbb
                                              http://chrigu.info/work/#post
                                              http://chrigu.info/work/#phbern               all my experience are under the pattern “work”
                                                                                            for every company, I worked for, is a new pattern
                                                                                            If I worked twice for the same company, there will be two entries

list of education:                           http://chrigu.info/education/#bfh
                                             http://chrigu.info/education/#unibe
                                             http://chrigu.info/education/#high-school

some of my interests:                        http://chrigu.info/interests/#it
                                             http://chrigu.info/interests/#sports
                                             http://chrigu.info/interests/#floorball
                                             http://chrigu.info/interests/#macrumors
                                          

I think that these IRIs will work also in the future. I am able to supplement all categories without restriction.

A way to “future proof”; collect as many information from friends and other people as possible and try to insert them into my IRIs. If I can match them all, my IRIs will be okey.
